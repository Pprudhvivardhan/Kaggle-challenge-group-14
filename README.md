# Spaceship Titanic - Predicting Dimensional Transport Kaggle-challenge-group-14

Spaceship Titanic - Predicting Dimensional Transport

The Spaceship Titanic competition hosted on Kaggle tasks participants with predicting whether passengers aboard a futuristic interstellar cruise were transported to an alternate dimension after a spacetime anomaly.
This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline that includes comprehensive EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using a combination of statistical methods and machine learning techniques.

 Dataset Overview
 Key Features:
**Categorical:** `HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, `Cabin`, `Destination`, `VIP`
**Numerical Columns**: Age, RoomService, FoodCourt ,ShoppingMall , Spa , VRDeck
  
##  Project Overview

###  Goals:
1. Clean and preprocess the raw data.
2. Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Engineer meaningful features.
4. Prepare data for modeling (splitting, encoding, scaling).

##  Data Cleaning

- **Missing Values** handled through:
   Group-wise imputations (e.g., median `Age` by group).
   Domain-based assumptions (e.g., inferring `CryoSleep` from zero expenditure).
- **Cabin Splitting** into:
   `Cabin_Deck`, `Cabin_Number`, `Cabin_Side`
- **Engineered Features**:
   `Total_Spending`: Sum of all expenditure columns
   `Is_Alone`: Boolean indicating solo traveler based on group

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  1. Univariate Analysis

- Distribution of individual numerical features using:
  - Histogram with KDE overlays (using Plotly)
  - Box plots (to detect outliers)

- Categorical distributions:
  - Count plots for `HomePlanet`, `Destination`, `Cabin_Deck`, etc.

### âœ… 2. Bivariate Analysis

- Relationship between `Transported` and:
  - Numerical features via **box + violin plots**
  - Categorical features via **stacked bar charts**
  - KDE overlays (comparison of distributions for `Transported` = 0 vs 1)
  - Grouped bar plots of mean values by class
