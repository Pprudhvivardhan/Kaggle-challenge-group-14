# Spaceship Titanic - Predicting Dimensional Transport Kaggle-challenge-group-14

Spaceship Titanic - Predicting Dimensional Transport

The Spaceship Titanic competition hosted on Kaggle tasks participants with predicting whether passengers aboard a futuristic interstellar cruise were transported to an alternate dimension after a spacetime anomaly.
This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline that includes comprehensive EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using a combination of statistical methods and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains personal and spending data for thousands of passengers. The key features include:

Categorical Features:

HomePlanet, CryoSleep, Cabin, Destination, VIP

Numerical Features:

Age, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck

Target Column:

Transported: Boolean indicating if the passenger was transported to another dimension

Column Descriptions : Â¶
PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.
HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.
Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
Age - The age of the passenger.
VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
Name - The first and last names of the passenger.
Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.

ðŸ“Œ  Observations in Train Data:
* There are total of 14 columns and 8693 rows in train data.
* Train data contains 119378 observation with 2324 missing values.
* All 12 feature columns have missing values in them with CryoSleep having highest missing values (217)
* Transported is the target variable which is only available in the train dataset.

* ðŸ“Œ  Observations in Test Data:
* There are total of 13 columns and 4277 rows in test data.
* Train data contains 54484 observation with 1117 missing values.
* All 12 feature columns have missing values in them with FoodCourt having highest missing values (106)

  
##  Project Overview

###  Goals:
1. Clean and preprocess the raw data.
2. Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Engineer meaningful features.
4. Prepare data for modeling (splitting, encoding, scaling).

##  Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values:

Median imputation for Age based on passenger group

Zero-spending inference to populate CryoSleep

Mode or most frequent values for categorical variables

Cabin Feature Engineering:

Split the Cabin into Cabin_Deck, Cabin_Number, and Cabin_Side for better interpretability

Additional Engineered Features:

Total_Spending: Combined cost of all onboard services

Is_Alone: Indicates if a passenger traveled without family/group

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Univariate Analysis

Numerical Features

Histograms + KDE for distribution

Boxplots to detect outliers and spread

Categorical Features

Count plots for key columns like HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin_Deck, etc.

### 2. Bivariate Analysis
Target vs Numerical Features

Box and violin plots

KDE overlays comparing Transported classes

Target vs Categorical Features

ðŸ¤– Modeling & Evaluation
Trained multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost

LightGBM

Stacking Classifiers

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

Cross-validation with stratified K-fold

Final Model Selection based on leaderboard performance and validation accuracy
